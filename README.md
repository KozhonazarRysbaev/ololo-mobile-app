## Technologies

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) with [Expo](https://expo.io/) is used to implement most of the features for both plaforms: iOS and Android.
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is used to add static typing and Prettier is applied automatically to every PR  to make formatting consistent.

## Getting started

To run the project locally, the recommended approach is to use [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/). If you don't have it installed run `npm install -g expo-cli` to install it globally.

Then, run the following commands in the project directory:

    npm install
    expo start
